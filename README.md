## Progress

# 3rd Addition (This will be carried out by Chase Bledsoe).
The already existing plane will be changed to a UFO, and will move super rapidly across the screen. 
- 

To win the game, a player must blow up the UFO. 
- 

This will trigger an end cutscene, portraying the demise of the alien attackers. 
- 

In addition, we will enhance the gameâ€™s graphics by drawing buildings on the surface of the earth which will be destroyed as the game goes on. 
- 

To increase this effect, enemy missiles will also explode upon impact when they hit the bottom of the screen.
